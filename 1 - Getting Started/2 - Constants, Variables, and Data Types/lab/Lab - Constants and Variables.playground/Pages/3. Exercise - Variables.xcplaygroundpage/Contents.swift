 */
var schooling = 19
print("I have completed \(schooling) years of school :shudder:")
/*:
 Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
schooling += 1
print("I have now completed \(schooling) years of school, oey vey!")
/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
 */
print("variables allow you to change the value after the initial assignment.")
